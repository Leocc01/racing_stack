"""
Static-obstacle avoidance planner.

Plans an evasion path around up to three visible STATIC obstacles at once, in
Frenet space, anchored at the car's current pose.

Two properties matter and both are deliberate:

1. It reads `/tracking/obstacles` DIRECTLY. The previous version waited for the
   state machine to nominate an obstacle on `/behavior_strategy`
   (`overtaking_targets`), which is only populated from
   `cur_gb_wpnts.closest_target` -- and that field is cleared at the top of every
   state-machine loop and only re-filled by `_check_free_frenet(cur_gb_wpnts)`,
   which `OvertakingTransition` never calls. So the moment the car entered
   OVERTAKE the nomination vanished, this planner lost its obstacle, published an
   empty path, and the state machine dropped back out of OVERTAKE. Reading the
   tracker directly breaks that loop. `/behavior_strategy` is still consumed, but
   only as a *hint* for which candidate to prefer, so the two agree when the state
   machine does have an opinion.

2. It plans in FRENET and converts to cartesian, instead of fitting a cartesian
   BPoly through {ego, apex, return}. A three-point cartesian spline from the car
   to an apex 8 m away is essentially a straight chord: on any curved section it
   cuts the corner, leaves the eroded map, and every candidate is rejected. The
   rejection disappears only once the car is close enough for the chord to be
   short -- which is exactly the "crawl up to the obstacle, then plan" behaviour
   this file used to have. A Frenet path follows the raceline curvature by
   construction, so a 10 m lookahead is as plannable as a 2 m one.

Subscribes:
    - `/tracking/obstacles`        : tracked obstacles (static ones are the input)
    - `/behavior_strategy`         : optional hint for which obstacle to prefer
    - `/car_state/odom_frenet`     : ego state in Frenet coordinates
    - `/car_state/odom`            : ego state in cartesian coordinates (heading)
    - `/global_waypoints`          : global waypoints (Frenet converter reference)
    - `/global_waypoints_scaled`   : scaled global waypoints (bounds + speeds)

Publishes:
    - `/planner/avoidance/otwpnts` : the evasion trajectory (remapped to
                                     /planner/avoidance/static_otwpnts by the launch file)
    - `/planner/avoidance/markers` : trajectory visualization
    - `/planner/avoidance/latency` : planning callback duration [s] (when measure:=true)

        Was `clip(pre_dist_gain * speed, 2.0, 4.0)`, i.e. a function of speed
        alone, which pinned the whole move into the last four metres before the
        obstacle however early it had been detected. The offset is ~0.55 m, so
        `kappa = 6*dd/L^2` came out at 0.21 rad/m over 4 m -- and the state
        machine's `static_avoidance_cb` -> `update_velocity` feeds exactly that
        kappa through the ggv (ay_max 4.5), capping the avoidance at 4.7 m/s.
        Over 8 m the same offset is 0.052 rad/m and stops limiting speed at all.
        Lowering the path's curvature is the only lever on speed DURING an
        avoidance, which is why this is the one number that matters here.

        Three terms:
          * the room that actually exists between the car and the apex -- the
            move can never begin behind the car;
          * `pre_dist_gain * speed`, the old speed term, with gain and ceiling
            raised so it stops binding before the room does. Whatever it leaves
            over becomes the flat hold in `_build_path`: the car holds its
            current offset until `move_start` instead of drifting sideways for
            the whole approach and spending track width it may need later. When
            the obstacle is closer than the speed term wants, the hold is zero
            and the move starts at the car -- which is what the old code did in
            every case;
          * `_corner_exit_limit`, which stops the span beginning inside a
            corner -- floored at `pre_dist_corner_min_m`, the OLD ceiling, so an
            obstacle in a corner is approached exactly as it was before and this
            change can only ever lengthen an approach, never shorten one.
